        This specification defines constraints and extensions to TTML
        to support the contribution
        of real time streams of content,
        primarily subtitles and captions,
        from an authoring or playout system
        via a controlled network
        to an encoder
        whose output is intended for wider distribution.
        It also defines a system model including <em>nodes</em>,
        <em>sequences</em> and <em>streams</em> useful for modelling
        such systems.
        The primary use case is the transfer of
        live subtitles and captions
        within a broadcast or media preparation
        environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        This document is derived from the [[EBU-TT-Live-1-0]]
        where some informative information has been removed, and
        the normative requirements have been re-based on [[TTML1]]
        where in the original they were based on the [[EBU-TT-1-2]]
        profile of TTML1.
      </p>
      <p>
        The extensions and constraints defined in this
        specification are usable with both [[TTML1]] and [[TTML2]].
        No constraints added to [[TTML2]] invalidate the extensions
        and constraints specified herein.
      </p>
      <p>
        No requirement is presented here for any
        subtitle presentation device used by an audience member
        to behave differently in the presence of live subtitles
        compared to prepared subtitles:
        rather, it is envisaged that any processing required
        to manage the two cases,
        and the transitions between them,
        occurs in the broadcaster domain.
        However the use of SMPTE time code is not supported.
      </p>
      <p>
        These extensions are based on [[EBU-TT-Live-1-0]]
        developed by <a href="https://tech.ebu.ch/home">EBU</a> and
        benefit from technical consensus and implementation experience
        gathered there.

      <h2>Scope</h2>
      <p>
        This specification defines extensions to TTML
        to support the contribution
        of real time streams of content,
        primarily subtitles and captions,
        from an authoring or playout system
        via a controlled network
        to an encoder
        whose output is intended for wider distribution.
        The primary use case is the transfer of
        live subtitles and captions
        within a broadcast or media preparation
        environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        These extensions are designed to support direct contribution
        of streams of TTML in the absence of any other data structure that might
        provide additional semantics, or to work within such other structures.
      </p>
      <p>
        This document describes how [[TTML1]] 
        (and by extension [[TTML2]] and
        non-conflicting derived profiles of either) 
        can be used in a broadcasting environment 
        to carry subtitles and captions that are created
        in real time ("live" or from a prepared file)
        from an authoring station
        to an encoder
        prior to distribution,
        via intermediate processing units.
        It does this by specifying:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          a system model consisting of processing nodes
          that pass streams of subtitles along a chain;
        </li>
        <li>
          a content profile specifying the data format of each document
          in a live subtitle stream;
        </li>
        <li>
          a mechanism by which content providers can
          model and potentially improve synchronisation
          between the subtitles and the audio to which they relate;
        </li>
        <li>
          a mechanism for interoperable management of the
          handover from one subtitler to the next,
          to generate a single output subtitle stream.
        </li>
        <li>
          an extension facility to allow other types of
          live documents to be defined in future specifications,
          for example for passing messages between subtitlers.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The mechanisms by which such streams of TTML are carried are out of
        scope of this document; however the requirements for any specification
        of such a mechanism are included.

    <section id="conformance">
      <p>
        Normative text describes indispensable or mandatory elements.
        It contains the conformance keywords ‘shall’,
        ‘should’ or ‘may’, defined as follows:
      </p>
      <p>
        <dfn>Shall</dfn>
        and
        <dfn>shall not</dfn>:

        <dfn>should not</dfn>:
        Indicate that, among several possibilities,
        one is recommended as particularly suitable,
        without mentioning or excluding others;
        OR indicate that a certain course of action is
        preferred but not necessarily required;
        OR indicate that (in the negative form)
        a certain possibility or course of action
        is deprecated but not prohibited.
      </p>
      <p>
        <dfn>May</dfn>

      <p>
        <dfn>Default</dfn>
        identifies mandatory (in phrases containing “shall”)
        or recommended
        (in phrases containing “should”) presets that can,
        optionally, be overwritten by user action
        or supplemented with other options in advanced applications.
        Mandatory defaults must be supported.
        The support of recommended defaults is preferred,
        but not necessarily required.
      </p>
      <p>
        Informative text is potentially helpful to the user,
        but it is not indispensable
        and it does not affect the normative text.
        Informative text does not contain any conformance keywords.
      </p>
      <p>
        A conformant implementation is one which
        includes all mandatory provisions (‘shall’)
        and, if implemented,
        all recommended provisions (‘should’) as described.
        A conformant implementation need not implement
        optional provisions (‘may’)
        and need not implement them as described.

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      The topic of live subtitle or caption authoring,
      routing and encoding is large.
      Organisations such as broadcasters,
      access service providers and other content providers
      face a variety of challenges ranging from the editorial,
      for example word accuracy and rate, to the technical,
      for example how the text data is routed from the author to the encoder,
      what format it should be in and how it can be configured and monitored.
      The classical way to address such a large “problem space” is
      to divide it up into more easily solvable constituent parts.
      This approach is taken here.
    </p>
    <p>
      This document also provides useful options for
      mixing the play out of prepared subtitle documents and live subtitles,
      a problem that arises for all broadcast channels
      whose output is not either 100% pre recorded or 100% live.
    </p>
    <p>
      Authoring conventions,
      for example the use of colour to identify speakers,
      are not directly addressed in this document;
      however care has been taken to ensure that
      the technical solutions presented here
      can support a variety of conventions.
      System setup,
      configuration,
      management,
      resilience,
      monitoring
      and recovery
      are likewise addressed indirectly
      by modelling the potential architectures in the abstract
      and designing the data format to support those architectures.
    </p>
    <section id="intro-exchange-format">
      <h3>TTML as an exchange format for live and prepared subtitles.</h3>
      <p>
        TTML and profiles such as [[ttml-imsc1.1]] are intended for general use
        in exchanging prepared <a>subtitles</a> and <a>captions</a>.
        This workflow is extended by this document to include exchange of
        live subtitles and captions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Notwithstanding that primary intent,
        this specification may be applied to any application of
        TTML that is compatible with delivery in temporal fragments.

        The content is carried in <dfn>sequences</dfn> of Document Instances.
        <!-- NM: Make Document Instance a defined term -->
        In addition to the text it can contain styling, layout, timing and
        additional metadata information.
      </p>

        data-include-format="text">
      </pre>
      <p>
        Each document instance indicates the sequence to which it belongs
        using a <dfn>Sequence Identifier</dfn>. The order is set by a
        <dfn>Sequence Number</dfn>.

      <p>
        The concept of sequence identification is separate to
        service identification.
        Document metadata may be used to allow authors to
        identify the services for which
        the sequence is intended to carry subtitles,
        also known as the broadcast channel etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sequences of live documents are transferred between
        <dfn>Nodes</dfn>.
        Such transfers are called
        <dfn>Streams</dfn>.
        Nodes can consume, process and/or output Documents.
        Different types of Node can send or receive varying numbers of
        Streams to or from other Nodes.
        Some examples are shown below.
      </p>
      <p>
        <dfn>Processing Nodes</dfn>
        output sequences that differ or may differ from those at the input.
        An authoring station or a spellchecker are examples of processing nodes.
      </p>
      <p>
        <dfn>Passive Nodes</dfn>
        simply receive and optionally pass on sequences
        from input to output without modifying
        the content of any document in the sequence.
        A distributing node or an encoder are examples of passive nodes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Documents can use different types of timing.
        Only one Document can be active at any given time.
        If different Documents overlap in time,
        the Document with the highest Sequence number ‘wins’.
      </p>
      <div class="note">
        <p>
          When a document includes explicit times using the 
          <code>begin</code>, <code>end</code> or <code>dur</code>
          attributes, and is available before its begin time, 
          it becomes active
          at its begin time, 
          until the next document is active, 
          or it reaches its end.
        </p>
        <p>
          Documents may be sent before they become active;
          documents may be re evaluated later,
          for example to archive a corrected version of
          the subtitles after broadcast,
          or to retain precise timings from source documents.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="note">
        <p>
          If no <code>begin</code> or <code>end</code> attributes 
          are set in the Document,
          subtitles will be active as soon as they are received,
          until the next Document is active or the <code>dur</code>
          on the <code>body</code> element has been reached, if set.
        </p>
        <p>
          The typical use case is sending subtitles as fast as possible
          for live subtitling.
          This simple scheme may not be optimal,
          because it does not support all the possible use cases,
          for example creating archive versions is more difficult.

          <a href="#use-case-figure"></a> illustrates a simple example use case
          in which a subtitler uses an authoring tool
          to create a stream of live subtitles.
          Those are then transferred either:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>via a direct IP connection to an Improver
            and then on to an encoder; or</li>

            and then de-embedded for passing to an encoder.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          A potential addition to this workflow would be
          an additional connection

          archive [[TTML1]] document for later reuse.

      <p>
        The Improver defined in this document is a processing node that could,
        for example, insert a defined compensating delay,
        check content for correct spelling,
        ensure that prohibited code points are not propagated or
        perform other transformations to generate output suitable for encoding.

          each group member takes a turn to contribute
          for a period of time before handing over to the next subtitler.

        <p>
          Each subtitler creates a distinct sequence of subtitles for their turn.
          Each of those input sequences has a different sequence identifier.
          The authoring stations emit the sequences as streams.
          As part of an externally orchestrated handover process
          a <a>handover manager</a> node receives all the streams,
          combines them and emits a new continuous stream.
          This new output stream’s sequence has a different sequence identifier
          from each of the input sequences.
        </p>
        <p>
          Incidentally, each subtitler may subscribe to,

          creates a new sequence whose contents are
          time aligned relative to the audio track’s time frame,
          using time stamps from a common clock source.
          The new sequence is issued as a stream with a new sequence identifier.

        <h4>Retrospective Corrections</h4>
        <p>
          A subtitler authors a live subtitle stream whose sequence
          is archived for later reuse.
          On noticing an error the subtitler issues
          a retrospectively timed correction.
          The archive process uses data within the sequence
          to apply the correction such that
          the error it corrects is not apparent
          within the generated archive document.

      <dfn data-lt="Caption|Captions|Subtitle|Subtitles">Captions and subtitles</dfn>
      The term “captions” describes on screen text for use
      by deaf and hard of hearing audiences.
      Captions include indications of the speakers and relevant sound effects.
      The term “subtitles” describes on screen text for translation purposes.
      For easier reading only the term “subtitles” is used
      in this specification as the representation of captions and subtitles
      is the same here.
      In this specification the term “captions” is used
      interchangeably with the term “subtitles” (except where noted).

        In practice any source of SMPTE timecode,

        <p class="informative">
          The rules for determining resolved begin and end times
          in this section require comparison of times
          that are potentially derived from different clock sources.
          For example the <a>availability time</a> of a document
          can be found by inspecting a local system clock whereas
          the <a>earliest computed begin time</a> in the document
          can be in a timebase relating to a different reference clock.
        </p>

        <p>
          For the purpose of making these comparisons
          the following times shall be converted
          to values on the same timebase:

          <li><a>latest computed end time</a> in the document;</li>
          <li>any externally specified document deactivation time.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The <dfn>earliest computed begin time</dfn> is defined as
          the earlier of
          a) the earliest computed begin time of any leaf element in the document
          and b) the earliest computed time corresponding to
          a specified <code>begin</code> attribute value on an element
          that either has no <code>end</code> attribute 
          or has an <code>end</code> attribute value that is
          later than the <code>begin</code> attribute value.
        </p>
        <p class="note">
          In the case that a root to leaf path contains
          elements all of which omit a <code>begin</code> attribute value
          this evaluates to the value zero on the document’s timebase.
        </p>

        <p>
          The <dfn>latest computed end time</dfn> is defined as
          the latest computed end time corresponding to
          a specified <code>end</code> attribute value on an element
          that either has no specified <code>begin</code> attribute
          or has an <code>end</code> attribute value that is
          later than the <code>begin</code> attribute value.

          It is syntactically permitted for an element
          to have a <code>begin</code> attribute value that is

          in this case normally the element would be considered
          never to be active;
          this is why such elements are excluded
          from the calculation of the

        It is out of scope of this document

        Any node that receives and emits streams is

            Since this is essentially equivalent to
            a longer carriage latency
            no modification to the documents is required.
            The <a>Buffer Delay Node</a> increases the <a>availability time</a>
            of the documents received by <a>Nodes</a> receiving the sequence
            (downstream).
            It is primarily intended for delaying

        <li>
          A <a>Retiming Delay Node</a> modifies the times

          as part of a new <a>sequence</a> with
          a new <a>sequence identifier</a>.
          The times are modified such that all of
          the computed begin and end times within the document
          are increased by a non negative delay <a>offset period</a>.
          The Retiming Delay Node is primarily intended

          It is possible that delay functionality is combined with

          hence the requirement not to reorder is expressed in terms of
          subtitles not documents:

          a 1:1 relationship between input and output documents
          from a <a>Retiming Delay node</a>,
          though such a relationship would be expected

          If varying the delay <a>offset period</a>,
          take care to manage the other timings
          to avoid inadvertently changing
          the displayed order of subtitles;
          for example one strategy could be
          to treat delay <a>offset period</a> changes as
          target values that are arrived at over a fixed period,
          so instead of jumping from, say, 10s to 4s in one step
          an implementation could gradually reduce the offset
          from 10s to 4s over, say, a 6s period.
          Another strategy when the delay varies is
          to allow the node (or a downstream node)
          to apply its own logic,
          which could result in documents being skipped
          to achieve the desired synchronisation.

    <h3>Handover</h3>
    <p class="informative">
      In a live subtitle authoring environment it is common practice for
      multiple subtitlers to collaborate with each other
      in the creation of subtitles for a single programme.
      From an encoder perspective,
      it is desirable to manage only a single stream of live subtitles.
      To mediate between the streams that each subtitler creates
      we will refer to a <a>Handover Manager</a> node. See
      <a href="#handover-figure"></a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The 
      <dfn data-lt="handover manager node|handover manager">Handover Manager</dfn>
      subscribes to
      a set of <a>sequences</a>
      and selects <a>documents</a> from one <a>sequence</a> at a time,
      switching between <a>sequences</a> dependent on
      parameters within the <a>documents</a>.
      It then emits a new <a>sequence</a> of <a>documents</a> representing
      the time interleaved combination of subtitles from each of the authors,
      where each output <a>document</a> is derived from
      an input <a>document</a> from the <a>selected sequence</a>.
      See also <a href="#handover-sequences-figure"></a>
      for an example of handover sequences.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <a>Handover Manager node</a> shall use
      a 'who claimed control most recently' algorithm
      for selecting the <a>sequence</a>,
      based on a control token parameter within each document.

        it also facilitates monitoring.

        Other schemes for directing handover are possible,

        The following parameters on the <code>tt:tt</code> element are provided
        to facilitate handover:
      </p>

      <p>
        The <a><code>ebuttp:authorsGroupIdentifier</code></a> is a string
        that identifies the group of authors
        from which a particular <a>Handover Manager</a> can choose.
        A <a>Handover Manager</a> should be configured
        to subscribe to all the <a>streams</a>
        whose <a>documents</a> have the same
        <a><code>ebuttp:authorsGroupIdentifier</code></a>
        except for its own output stream.
        Within a single <a>sequence</a>,
        all <a>documents</a> that contain the element
        <code>ebuttp:authorsGroupIdentifier</code> shall have the same
        <code>ebuttp:authorsGroupIdentifier</code>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <a>Handover Manager</a> may include within each <a>document</a>
        in its output <a>sequence</a> the parameter attributes
        <a><code>ebuttp:authorsGroupIdentifier</code></a> and
        <a><code>ebuttp:authorsGroupControlToken</code></a>
        from the current <a>selected sequence</a>.
        The <a>Handover Manager</a> includes within each output <a>document</a>
        the metadata attribute
        <code>ebuttm:authorsGroupSelectedSequenceIdentifier</code> [[EBU-TT-M]]
        set to the value of the source sequence’s 
        <a>sequence identifier</a> for that <a>document</a>.
        This is so that each subscriber
        to the <a>Handover Manager</a>'s output stream
        can know the current status,
        including any subscribed subtitle authoring stations.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <a>Handover Manager</a>’s normative behaviour is defined
        in <a href="#handover-manager-algorithm"></a>.

      <p>
        When present in a <a>document</a>,
        the <a><code>ebuttp:authorsGroupControlToken</code></a> is a number
        that the <a>Handover Manager</a> uses to identify which <a>sequence</a>
        to select: when a <a>document</a> is received with a higher value
        <a><code>ebuttp:authorsGroupControlToken</code></a>
        than that most recently received
        in the current <a>selected sequence</a>
        the <a>Handover Manager</a> switches to
        that <a>document</a>'s <a>sequence</a>,
        that is, it emits a <a>document</a> in its output <a>sequence</a>
        corresponding to and derived from the received <a>document</a>
        with the new control token without delay.
      </p>

      <p>
        Having selected a <a>sequence</a>,
        the <a>Handover Manager</a> emits
        further documents derived from that sequence
        until a new sequence is selected.
      </p>

      <p class="note">
        This means that the control token value can be lowered
        after taking control,
        by setting the control token value in a new document
        in the <a>selected sequence</a> to a lower number.
        Therefore the control token value does not need to increase forever.
      </p>

      <p>
        Regardless of the <a>selected sequence</a>,
        the <a>Handover Manager</a> does not emit any <a>documents</a>
        derived from input sequence documents that do not contain both
        the parameters <code>ebuttp:authorsGroupIdentifier</code> and
        <code>ebuttp:authorsGroupControlToken</code>.
      </p>

      <p class="note">
        Care should be taken if the <a>carriage mechanism</a> does not
        guarantee delivery of every <a>document</a> in the <a>sequence</a>
        in case a document intended to take control is lost.
        One strategy for avoiding this would be
        for the subtitle authoring station
        to observe the <a>Handover Manager</a>'s output and
        verify that control has been taken
        before lowering the control token value.
        Another strategy would be
        to maintain the high control token value and
        duplicate it in each document in the <a>sequence</a>
        until the sequence switch has been verified
        through another mechanism.

      Node conformance is defined in terms of their behaviours only.

      <p>
        <a>Carriage specification documents</a> shall describe
        the core networking dependencies and protocols,
        that is, if the mechanism is based on IP with TCP,
        IP with UDP, VBI in SDI, VANC in HD-SDI etc.
        and shall reference any related standards.
      </p>

      <p>
        <a>Carriage specifications</a> should not depend on
        non standard connection protocols,
        that is, those that do not conform
        to common definitions of open standards
        such as [[?OPENSTD]].
      </p>

      <p>
        Where the networking dependencies impose constraints,
        those constraints shall be described.
        For example a <a>carriage specification</a> for TTML Live over
        VBI embedded in SDI would impose a maximum data rate constraint.
        Another example could be the need for,

        and the synchronisation of live subtitles.
        For example an embedded mechanism such as

    <section id="carriage-stability">
      <h3>Stability</h3>
      <p>
        <a>Carriage specifications</a> shall describe or reference
        the expected level of connection stability,
        and operational approaches for maintaining that stability.
        For example this would include how the mechanism handles
        dropped connection fault conditions,
        whether data delivery is guaranteed
        or some documents may be lost as a matter of course,
        how the latency characteristics of the mechanism may vary,
        how version compatibility issues are managed,
        amd what statistics and monitoring are available.</p>
      <p class="note">
        A TCP socket based protocol would exhibit
        guaranteed data delivery behaviour at the possible expense of
        delivery timing;
        conversely a UDP based protocol would exhibit minimal delivery timing
        at the possible expense of data loss.
        These characteristics affect the stability of
        the operational connections,
        and need to be described so that stable systems can be engineered.

    <section id="carriage-interoperability">
      <h3>Interoperability</h3>
      <p>
        It is recommended that <a>carriage mechanisms</a>
        should be defined with interoperability in mind.
        Interfaces should not need to be hardware or vendor specific,
        should ideally publish details of available services on request,
        should self describe their external interfaces,
        and should permit any relevant configuration of
        the services available to be published.
        Where <a>carriage mechanisms</a> multiplex
        <a>TTML Live documents</a> with other data,
        e.g. by embedding in an HD-SDI signal,
        the mechanism shall be transparent to
        devices that are unable to process <a>TTML Live documents</a>,
        that is, the presence of <a>TTML Live documents</a> shall not
        cause a fault in compliant devices,
        for example by extending beyond fixed size data windows,
        including bytes with special meaning,
        mis-representing the <a>TTML Live documents</a> as
        an incompatible format etc.
